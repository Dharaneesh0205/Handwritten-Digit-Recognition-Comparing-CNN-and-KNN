This project compares the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) in classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, analyzing accuracy and efficiency. The implementation includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.

## Project Overview
The aim is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of CNN and KNN in recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of digits (0-9). The goal is to determine which algorithm achieves higher accuracy and better generalization on unseen data.

## Objectives
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize and reshape the MNIST dataset for compatibility with both models.
- **CNN Development**: Construct a CNN architecture that captures spatial features from the images using convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
- **KNN Implementation**: Implement the KNN algorithm to classify digits based on the majority vote of the K nearest neighbors, varying K to assess performance.
- **Model Training**: Train the CNN model and evaluate KNN on the same training set, monitoring accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Provide visual insights into the performance of both models, including accuracy and loss curves for CNN and accuracy metrics for KNN.

## Technical Details

### Dataset
- **MNIST**: 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits, each image being 28x28 pixels.

### CNN Architecture
- **Input Layer**: Reshaped to fit (28, 28, 1) for grayscale images.
- **Convolutional Layers**: 
  - 1st layer: 32 filters with (3, 3) kernel and ReLU activation.
  - 2nd layer: 64 filters with the same kernel size and activation.
- **Pooling Layers**: Max pooling layers to down-sample feature maps.
- **Dense Layers**: 
  - A hidden layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation.
  - An output layer with 10 neurons and softmax activation for classification.

### KNN Implementation
- The KNN algorithm classifies digits based on the majority vote of its K nearest neighbors, with performance evaluated using various values of K.

## Evaluation Metrics
- Model accuracy and loss for the CNN are evaluated on the test dataset. KNN's accuracy is assessed against varying K values, with cross-validation for reliability.

## Visualization
- Training and validation accuracy and loss for CNN are plotted, alongside KNN accuracy across different K values, to illustrate the comparative performance of both models.

## Expected Outcomes
The project anticipates that the CNN will achieve higher accuracy (typically above 98%), while KNN performance will vary based on the choice of K. Visualizations will provide insights into the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm in digit recognition tasks.

## Potential Extensions
- Experiment with deeper CNN architectures and different K values for KNN.
- Implement data augmentation for the CNN to improve robustness.
- Explore the use of hybrid models that combine CNN and KNN techniques for enhanced performance.
