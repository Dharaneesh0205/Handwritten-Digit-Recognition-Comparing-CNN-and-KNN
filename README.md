# Project Title: Handwritten Digit Recognition: Comparing CNN and KNN
This project compares the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) in recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, with CNN achieving over 98% accuracy. The implementation includes data preprocessing, model training, and visualizations to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.
Here’s a detailed description for a project that compares Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for handwritten digit recognition:


This project aims to compare the effectiveness of two different machine learning algorithms—Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)—in recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), with 60,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing.

## Project Overview
The primary objective is to evaluate the accuracy and performance of both CNN and KNN in classifying handwritten digits. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation, with a focus on visualizing results to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

## CNN Implementation
The CNN model consists of multiple layers, including:
- **Convolutional Layers**: To automatically extract features from the input images.
- **Pooling Layers**: To reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps while retaining essential information.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: To perform the final classification into one of the ten digit categories.

The CNN is trained using the Adam optimizer and employs techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting. Visualization of training performance is achieved through accuracy and loss plots over multiple epochs.

## KNN Implementation
The KNN algorithm classifies images based on the majority vote of its K nearest neighbors in the feature space. The performance of KNN is assessed by varying the number of neighbors (K) and evaluating accuracy on the test dataset. Cross-validation is employed to provide a more reliable estimate of KNN’s performance.

## Results and Comparison
The project includes a comprehensive comparison of the two models, highlighting:
- **Accuracy**: CNN typically achieves over 98% accuracy, while KNN's accuracy varies depending on the chosen K value.
- **Training Time**: CNN requires more time to train due to its complex architecture, while KNN is computationally efficient for smaller datasets.
- **Visualization**: Performance metrics for both algorithms are visualized, including accuracy and loss for CNN, and accuracy across different values of K for KNN.

## Getting Started
To run the project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`digit_recognition_comparison.ipynb`) to train and evaluate both models.
